		<h2>How to Use the Similarity Matcher</h2>
		<p>Simply type or paste in the two text bodies you want to compare in each of the two boxes and click on compare</p>
			
		<h2>How it Works</h2>
		<p >The similarity score you receive is based on the following algorithms:<br>
		<p>
			<div style="height: 125px;">
			<div class="container" >
				<button class="Cosine"onclick="myFunction(-1)">
					&lt
				</button>
				<button class="Cosine" id="buttonTitle">
					Learn about the algorithms
				</button>
				<button class="Cosine"onclick="myFunction(1)">
					&gt
				</button>
			</div>
				<div id="myDIV" style="font-size: 20px;">Press the arrows above to learn about the various algorithms used</div>
			</div>
		</p>

		

		<script>
		let y = 0;
		function myFunction(direction) {
		  	var x = document.getElementById("myDIV");
			if(y > 3 && direction == 1)
				y = 0;
			if(y <= -1 && direction == -1)
				y = 3;
		  	if (y == 0) {
		    	x.innerHTML = "<b>Cosine Similarity:</b> Cosine Similarity checks how similar pieces of texts are, it does this by turning the words into vectors. The vectors are then used to calculate a numerator which is the amount of times the words appear in the texts. A denominator is then calculated by how often the word appears in each text and then square rooted. while disregarding the size of the two texts. Even if one is half the length of the other.";
		  	} 
			else if(y == 1) {
		    	x.innerHTML = "<b>Jaccard Index:</b> Jaccard Index checks how similar pieces of texts are by how many common words exist over the total amount of words in the text.";
		  	}
			else if(y == 2) {
				x.innerHTML = "<b>Levenstein</b>";
			}
			else if(y == 3) {
				x.innerHTML = "<b>Monge Elkan</b>";
			}
			y+=direction;
		}
		</script>
		<br><br>
		<p>Furthermore, you also get to see the top matching sentences. The result will also give an overall percentage of how similar the texts are, and an individual percentage for each of the algorithms.</p>
